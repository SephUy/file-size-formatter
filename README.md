# File Size Formatter

This Rust program converts a given file size into different units (bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes) and formats the output accordingly. The input can be provided in various units such as `b`, `kb`, `mb`, or `gb`.


## Description

The application takes the size and unit as a command-line argument and prints its converted value. I used the Rust template from week 3's external lab exercise of Coursera's Rust Fundamentals, which can be found at this [repository](https://github.com/alfredodeza/rust-template).

## Usage

```bash
cargo run "5 gb"
```
